# Minesweeper

## Description
Minesweeper is a terminal game built in Ruby that plays just like the original windows game. Type in a coordinate to unveil a square. Type 'f' to flag/unfag a square instead.

Minesweeper also includes save-state functionality. Type 's' to save a game that you can pick up the next time you run the game.

There is a High Scores table that saves the fastest completion times.
